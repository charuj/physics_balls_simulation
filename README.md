# physics_balls_simulation
A visual physics simulation using p5 to depict balls dropping and colliding with one another. \
Considers the impact of gravity, friction and Hooke's law (ball pushes the ground and other colliding balls with a restoring force proportional to its displacement from the equilibrium position). \

\

bouncing_main.py runs the simulation. Everytime this is run, a new set of randomly initialized balls are created with random colours and positions on the canvas.\ 
bouncing_balls.py has the class Ball which has functions for giving the balls velocity and mimicking collisions.
