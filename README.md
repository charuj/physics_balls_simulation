# physics_balls_simulation
A visual physics simulation using p5 to depict balls dropping and colliding with one another.
Considers the impact of gravity, friction and Hooke's law (ball pushes the ground and other colliding balls with a restoring force proportional to its displacement from the equilibrium position).
